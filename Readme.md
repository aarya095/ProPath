# ProPath: Intelligent Career Trajectory Modeling Using Machine Learning

## Overview

ProPath is a machine learning-based application that analyzes a user's skills, current job role, and experience to predict the next possible career role. It also recommends relevant skills and estimates career growth potential.

The system is designed as a lightweight MVP using FastAPI for the backend and Streamlit for the user interface.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd propath
```

---

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

#### For Linux (Ubuntu with fish shell)

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate.fish
```

#### For Bash (optional)

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### 3. Install Dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4. Prepare Dataset

* Place your dataset inside:

```
data/dataset.csv
```

Ensure it contains:

* skills
* current_job_title
* years_of_experience
* next_job_role
* growth_category

---

### 5. Train the Model

```
cd app/model
python train.py
```

This will generate:

* model.pkl
* vectorizer.pkl

---

### 6. Run FastAPI Backend

Go back to root directory:

```
cd ../../
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Open API docs:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

---

### 7. Run Streamlit Frontend

Open a new terminal:

```
streamlit run streamlit_app/app.py
```

---

## Usage

1. Enter skills, job title, and experience
2. Click "Generate Prediction"
3. View:

   * Predicted role
   * Growth category
   * Recommended skills
4. Download the generated report

---

## Important Notes

* Ensure FastAPI server is running before starting Streamlit
* Model must be trained before prediction
* Dataset should be clean and properly formatted

---

## Future Enhancements

* Integration with LinkedIn API
* Advanced ML models (Deep Learning)
* Improved recommendation system
* Deployment on cloud platforms
